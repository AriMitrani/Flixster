# Project 1 - Flixster

Flixster shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current movies** from the Movie Database API
* [x] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
* [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Title, Poster Image, Overview (Portrait mode)
  * [x] Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)
* [x] Allow user to view details of the movie including ratings within a separate activity

The following **stretch** features are implemented:
* [x] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
* [x] Apply rounded corners for the poster or background images using [Glide transformations](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#transformations)
* [ ] Apply the popular [View Binding annotation library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-ViewBinding) to reduce boilerplate code.
* [ ] Allow video trailers to be played in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView from the details screen.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] N/A, we were only given 2 days so there wasn't much time to improve the app. I hope to explore more additional features in the coming weeks.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

As it was my first time using Android Studio, there was definitely a learning curve in understanding how the program worked as well as what I had to do. 
However, the video walkthrough helped a lot, and by the end, I fully understood everything that I coded.
I ran into a few bugs as I coded, but was able to solve almost all of them individually.
Since I completed basic functionality on Day 1, I spent Day 2 implementing stretch features/a nicer UI, as well as helping my peers with debugging.
